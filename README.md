# Sindy Solver for the Lorenz System
This code is a simple implementation of the Sindy solver for the 
Lorenz system. The code is written in Python 3.10. The code is 
based on the paper [1].

The code was a simple exercise to learn about the Sindy solver.
It supports polynomial systems up to order two.
